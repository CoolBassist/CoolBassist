### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub page!
---
I enjoy many facets of computer science and programming, but I especially enjoy learning about low level programming, such as assembly, C, retro computing, and [even creating my own CPU and designing a machine code language for it](https://github.com/CoolBassist/Homebrew-computer). I mostly program in Python and C++ both for their power, and ease of syntax.
