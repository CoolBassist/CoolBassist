### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a second year university student currently studying computer science. 
---
I enjoy many facets of computer science and programming, but I especially enjoy low level programming, such as assembly, C, or [even creating my own CPU and designing a machine code language for it](https://github.com/CoolBassist/Homebrew-computer). When I'm not getting close to the metal, I mostly program in Python and C++ both for their power, and ease of syntax.
